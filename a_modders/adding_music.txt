Introduction:


Hello, and welcome to this short guide, on how to easily add your own questlines into the Frackin' Universe custom questline GUI!
Note that this guide assumes that the user has very little knowledge about Starbound modding, and will hand hold you as much as it can.
If you don't even know how to setup your own mod, look here: https://starbounder.org/Modding:Modding_Basics
Sorry in advance if that annoys the living crap out of you. :)


Instructions:


First thing you'll need to do, is get a code editor program such as Notepad++.
Here is a link to make your life easier: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/
(I know there are others out there, and you think [insert better program name here] is better, but NP++ is more than enough)

You must also be able to view, and change file extension.
Look up "How to see file extensions in [operating system]" on Google if you can't and don't know how to enable that.

In your mod project, create the following directory: "/music"
Take the music file you'd like to add, and place them in that folder.
Note that their format must be in .ogg, stereo, 44100Hz, 16-bit PCM format.
If you don't know what that means, just look up "online ogg converter" on Google, and convert any music file format to .ogg, should work.

In your mod project, create the following directory: "/interface/scripted/fm_musicplayer"
And add a file named "fm_musicplayer.config.patch", and add the following code snippet:

[
	{
		"op":"add",
		"path":"/music/-",
		"value":
		{
			"name" : "###",				// Replace with the name it would display in the GUI
			"musicDirectory" : "###",	// Replace with the location of the file 
			"category" : "other"
		}
	}
]

Here is an example:

[
	{
		"op":"add",
		"path":"/music/-",
		"value":
		{
			"name" : "^orange;SR2^reset; | Beyond Reach",
			"musicDirectory" : "/music/Space Rangers 2 - Beyond Reach.ogg",
			"category" : "other"
		}
	}
]
