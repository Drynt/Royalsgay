  * precursor beamgun will now regenerate up to 20% health per second, draining up to 30% of energy for doing so. Still provides 25% more defense. energy and shield regen penalties reduced to 50% less, from 100%. No longer reduces energy regen block time to zero. Healing zone will no longer block most bandages. Weapon is no longer upgradable (it never had an effect), has no crit stats (it could not crit), and has a tier of 100 (which has no effect on its function, but looks cool.)

______________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.420^reset;

  -- Combat (Melee) --
  * Refined last updates weapon abilities to something less overbearing. You can find a full breakdown in a new codex, found in the Science Outpost bookshelf. Look for the Battle codex.
  * Combo atttacks in melee now drain 1% of current energy. This will make tech use require more strategy, as well as help remove stunlock spam ias a viable tactic for success.
  * Daggers have been completely overhauled, and are now aimable combo weapons with minimal knockback
  * Longsword colliders reduced, resulting in a far tighter arc.
  * Longswords have a larger grace time for combo attacks, and reduced time between those attacks
  * Longsword damage has been reduced

  * Scythes have a base bonus of +1% to Crit Chance
  * Scythe combos: +15% Crit Damage on first strike, +25% Crit Damage and +1% Crit Chance per combo strike

  -- Healing --  (Kherae)
  * Changed 'healingBonus' stat to apply to most forms of healing, instead of just healing items. This enables the following:
  * added new healingpenalty status effects, reducing healing from all sources by 10, 20 or 30%
  * the floran savages in brine star and certain microdungeons now use the third of these (30% reduced healing effectiveness), instead of the 'stun' effect.
  * healingBonus (the above effect, and all uses of it) now affects all sources of healing.
  * adjusted blood pick description to reflect healing changes
  * X'i heal item blocking method corrected.

  -- Armor --
  * corrected the sanguine set's piece tooltip to reflect its currentt behavior.

  -- WEAPONS Changes --  (testing some ideas)
  Longsword: Now focused on higher defense combat. When used with a shield you gain increased Shield Bash and Defense but lose 50% crit chance.
  When used dual-wielded they lose some utility and suffer 20% damage and protection loss and 50% less Crit Chance and move slower. You gain 12% Energy. Single-wielding increases power and crit chance.

  Mace: High impact, high stun. Maces increase HP, Protection and Shield Bash when wielded with shields. Dual wielded, they lose crit chance, energy, power and stun chance. Single-wielding increases power and stun chance.
  Katana: When used with shields, lose protection, power and crit chance. When dual-wielded with large blades, lose protection power and damage. Dual-wielded with small blades increases move speed, crit damage and max energy. Paired with one-handed ranged, gain speed and crit damage at the expense of power.
  
  -- Production --
  * adjusted furnace code. it now will run if there is a bonus OR normal output, and can accept tables or strings for normal outputs.

  -- Bees --
  * Arctic and Volcanic Frames have had their purposes reversed to improve consistency
  
  -- Misc --

  * corrected a minor punctuation mistake in skath dialog (Kherae)
  * Adjusted tricorder stat display for the various slime effects to be more clear. they now match the status effects' names more closely. similarly edited armors that provide slime immunities to better reflect what protection they provide: immunity to slime effects as a broad category. (Kherae)
  * corrected extraction of ancientpowerconduit giving a pgi (Kherae)
  * No more Mysterious Parcels appear in the Dark Cavern. No more farming elder stuff early. (Rylasasin)
  * fu_deploymenthack.lua merged into fu_playerinit.lua (Kherae)
  * most of the light and dark regen effects' if/else blocks are condensed into formulas, for a smoother curve. (Kherae)
  * added condition check to a vanilla movement script, because apparently checking whether something exists before calling it is too hard for CF. (Kherae)
  * added atropus sea to atmospheric condensers, acts as atropus (Kherae)
  * Scythes no longer have 'axe' listed in their tags
  * added a missing caketop component 
  * Lobster Traps have a drastically reduced production rate
  * Pest Traps have a drastically reduced production rate
  * Code cleanup and typo corrections (kukagres)
  * Healing time reduced from 30 to 15 seconds. 30 seconds was ridiculous. Also added more audio and visual feedback when healing.
  * adjusted profit-cheesing prices at Science Outpost
  * further update to bows: removed vanilla bow/energybow anim file changes entirely. switched over to FU specific variants. FU and vanilla bows now use these variants  (Kherae)
  * removed bow overrides from vanilla harpoon gun, as these were causing errors.  (Kherae)
  * touched up on memento mori: skull tooltip text now fits fully. also, it won't fire death effects for admins who take 'lethal' damage anymore. added benefit of admins not losing med station buffs that way.  (Kherae)
  * touched up crew contract tooltips to make them fit better. gave them a bit more room to fit in.  (Kherae)
  * did the same for killpods. (Kherae)
  * Lowered Swim Boost speeds by 5% 
  * finished making various 'well' objects use 1/sqrt(wellCount) instead of 1/wellCount for production rates. more forgiving diminishing returns. (Kherae)
  * reworked pest and lobster traps. They are no longer infinite free-food machines. (Kherae)

  -- Bugs --
  * fixed zb sail implementation of player warp. players should now deploy to the dantalion in a mech. (Kherae)
  * clamped size rendering for mech health and energy bars (Kherae)
  * mech deployment script no longer draws beacons unless in a mech (Kherae)
  * added some minor sanity checks to some scripts. (Kherae)
  * Hylotl swimboost speed is no longer impossibly fast.
  * fixed shephard's pie being less expensive from the floran merchant than it was supposed to. (Kherae)
  * added missing futram_gate frames file (Kherae)
  * corrected minor bug in extraStatsWindow that made it stop working (Kherae)
  * refined memento mori code. it now properly saves and compares location info (whoops). this will invalildate all previous location data through it (Kherae)

______________________________________________

  * Cultist General improved
  * Evil Chefs have dialog
  * Secret entrance to cult ship added
  * Cult Scientists get their glasses back and lose their hood
  * The Dantalion: the way to get into the secret area has been changed, since the switches in that area would frequently get destroyed by the miniboss. If you wander up to a certain part in that room, Koichi will give you a hint on how to proceed. (Rylasasin)
  * Changed the mission music for the Dantalion to Cthulhu Reformed - Cybersphere. Not only has house cleaning' more than likely wore out its welcome by this point (It's a good song, but it doesn't need to play for everything,) Cybersphere just fits the mood far better. (Rylasasin)
  * Fixed a few units in the ambush room. They are now rocket launching units like they should be (instead of all snipers)  (Rylasasin)
  * Bounty Hunter update songs now added to the music box (loooong overdue!)  
  * The aformentioned cybersphere song is now added to the music box.

  * Bandits can spawn as a random race
  * Cockpit areas now have a guaranteed 'miniboss' captain to fight

  * Max Spawn is 3x the normal spawn (rooms that had 1 bandit can have up to 3, rooms that had 2 can have up to 6, rooms that had 3 can have up to 9,) though the spawnchance of all spawners (minus scientist and cockpit miniboss) is only 30-40%, so chances that you'll actually face that many is really low.
  * Added loot to the empty secret room in the Precursor dungeon

  -- Misc --
  * adjusted typos and recipe groups (kukagres)
  * healing items now have a cooldown relative to their duration. The formula is max(30-initialDuration,0), which effectively normalizes healilng items around 30s intervals with some care taken for longer effects. (Kherae)
  * Wraith Set no longer uses the wrong stat for poison immunity, and added unlocks/recipe (Kherae)
  * Shrine of Souls added (Kherae)
  * added recipe for Iron Gear tile (Kukagres)

  * Updated credits
  * Precursor Furniture is now crafted using Precursor Alloy and cannot be printed (Silvertip)

  -- Bugs --
  * Fixed a few guns and shields on the cultistgeneral and cultistassault. Hopefully this is the last of the missing gear issues with them (Rylasasin)
  * Fixed crash with The Dantalion  (Rylasasin)
  * Fixed a missing general/assault weapon (Rylasasin)
  * Thanatite Broadsword and Shortsword now require Thanatite to craft
  * biolominescense should no longer error
  * corrected a PGI equpped on cultists

  -- Misc --
  * Space station Trade Goods are now affected by charisma (Kherae)
  * Harvester Beamgun tooltip now states its alt will not work on Aeroponic or Hydroponic tiles (edward spec)
  * You can now craft clay with your bare hands via dirt + water

  * added fuel amount labeling to several items. (Kherae)
  * Duplicator output throttled to prevent lag (Kherae)
  * Removed the DO NOT USE branch from the research tree since despite the giant 'DO NOT USE' explanation, people keep asking if they can use it.
  * Gave BYOS and FR toggles in sail a different icon (switch) to tell players they are switches. they also state they are toggles. (Kherae)
  * Swim Boost speeds slightly decreased
  * Rice can now grow in deeper water and won't consume the soil moisture.
  * further refinement to racial descriptions, including fixes for those that didnt fit on the char screen tooltip (Kherae)

  * adjusted item network codex (Kherae)
  * added item network codexes to science outpost library (Kherae)
  
  -- Dungeons --
  * The PNG version of the Cultist Altar has been replaced with a json version that has a randomized spawner. Can spawn a basic, scientist, assault, sniper, or rocket cultist in order from most common to rarist. (Rylasasin)
  * Cultists spawned on the altars, ship, and lair are now tied to the world/instance, rather than spawning with a random level. (Rylasasin)
  * Readjusted space enemy groups so they now use the spawner. Might need further adjustment. Basically, enemy groups are now completely random instead of a bunch of set groups. You never know what you will encounter (nor how many) in any space area now. (Rylasasin)
  * Converted a few microdungeons from my FFS Dungeons and Encounters mod. Namely, the Cultist/Pirate (now bandit) tents, and the Bandit Tower. They have randomized spawners. I don't know how you want to distribute those, so I'll leave that up to you. (Rylasasin)
  * New Space Encounter: Elite Bandit Asteroid Base. Another conversion from my FFS mod, this time a much heavier makeover. They are the same types of FU Bandits that appear on Eden worlds. There's a wrexem boss in the first floor to replace the pirate boss. He's a placeholder until we can come up with another monster/npc to replace him. (Kherae)
  * Removed 'wastelandquests' dungeon from rotation. It no longer serves any purpose since you can get the questgiver's quest from the science outpost. (Rylasasin)

  * corrected edible neptunium not applying proper food effects (Kherae)
  * sanity checks for some biome patches (Kherae)
  * turning off FR now affects food properly,shutting off bonuses and penalties entirely. FR toggle text updated to reflect this. (Kherae)
  * further fix for npcs dying to bongos, etc., due to vanilla spaghetti (Kherae)
  * Corrected access to a X'i recipe for Uranium Ore
  * Corrected the displayed fuel amount on hydrogen cores. they give 8k, not 5k. (Kherae)
  * reverted hydrogen bomb to using its assigned bomb effect, instead of 'atomsmasherboomyellow' (Kherae)
  * neutron bomb fixed up. should no longer fizzle. does bounce a bit weirdly now. Also gave it tiered 'gravity' ranges, making it marginally more dangerous.  (Kherae)
  * corrected an incorrect path to a moved status effect icon (Kherae)
  * moved 'fuelAmount' from its erroneous placement on the deuterium liquid to the liquid item. (Kherae)
